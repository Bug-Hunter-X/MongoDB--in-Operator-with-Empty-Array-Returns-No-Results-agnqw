# MongoDB $in Operator with Empty Array

This repository demonstrates a common pitfall when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with an empty array.  The issue arises because an empty `$in` array effectively filters out all documents, regardless of the field's value.

**Problem:**
Incorrect usage of `$in` with an empty array leads to unexpected empty result sets.

**Solution:**
Handle empty arrays explicitly by either adding a check before the query or using a different query strategy (like `$exists` or modifying the query condition based on the array's content).
